# ESO Logic

Extended state observer (ESO) is featured with online estimating both the system's states and the total effect of external disturbance as well as nonlinear uncertain dynamics. The original ESO design proposed for the cascade-of-integrator system without measurement noise. In the last years, multifarious modified ESOs have also been developed to handle many engineering systems captured by the models with general nonlinear structure, time-delay, the noises with stochastic properties, and etc. Furthermore, some novel designs of ESO to deal with the estimation problem of uncertain nonlinear systems with time-delay and measurement biases are discussed. We believe this overview will be helpful for practitioners in applications of recent modified ESOs.<br><br>Source:<br><br>:one: X. Zhang, X. Zhang, W. Xue, and B.
